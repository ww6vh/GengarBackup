For the PokeCardApp, the major functionality that we worked on was the tab bar because it is important for changing between the Wishlist, MyCards, and MyDecks. The tab bar is currently functioning, and have fragments inside, which is where lists would be placed.

The first minor functionality in progress is the firebase login system. Ideally, users would be able to add their emails and passwords, which would be added to the database. Then, when users log in, it should check the database to verify if they can log in. The login page is present, and the firebase connections have been created, but there are verifications issues, possibly involving the SHA code, so we are having issues interacting with the firebase database.

The second minor functionality in progress is the GPS functionality which is supposed to locate the user and find the nearest card shop. We have the project functioning such that the map will open google maps. But we are still having issues feeding the location into the map.
